"Do one thing, and do it well." `hush` is a lightweight chat application for
textual and audio communication between two computers. It is not meant to be
used for conference calls, or sending files, or creating chat rooms - it simply
opens a connection between two computers and sends text and audio over it, in
real-time.

Although the two computer are concepetually equal, due to the realities of
networking, one must be the "server" (listening on a port) and the other the
"client".
